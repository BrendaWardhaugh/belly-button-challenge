In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

### Steps:

* I used the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.
* Then created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
* Then created a bubble chart that displays each sample.
* Displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
* Displayed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
* Updated all the plots when a new sample is selected.
* Finally, created a gauge chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.
